OlumniNet
===========================

Social Network application tailored specifically for Olin Alumni. Two-week Sprint for Mobile Prototyping, Fall '13.

Anyone who's gone to Olin can tell you one of the best parts is the multitude of mailing lists. Mailing Lists are one of the primary ways in which Oliners connect and distribute information. In this sprint, we aimed to create an application that essentially recreated Olin's mailing list system, but for use with Olin Alumni instead. We created a separate app instead of using the existing system because alumni didn't want to interfere with current Oliners, in fear of being "creepy".
